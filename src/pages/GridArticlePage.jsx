                You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts
                and ideas. Do you need a manager? Remind me to thank John for a
                lovely weekend. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to
                save the planet? Here's my chance. Forget the fat lady! You're
                obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Hey, take a
                look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Checkmate... I gave it a cold?
                I gave it a virus. A computer virus. My dad once told me, laugh
                and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something
                to cry about you little bastard! Yeah, but your scientists were
                so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop
                to think if they should. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A
                computer virus. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to

                King Kong? My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with
                you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little
                bastard! Must go faster. Yes, Yes, without the oops! You're a

                ideas. Do you need a manager? Yeah, but your scientists were so
                preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to
                think if they should. You really think you can fly that thing?

                King Kong? I was part of something special. You're a very
                talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do
                you need a manager? Life finds a way. You know what? It is
                beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. We gotta burn the rain
                forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE!
                'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want
                it anymore! This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio,
                reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. So you two dig up,
                dig up dinosaurs? Checkmate... Forget the fat lady! You're
                obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Do you have
                any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. Hey, take a
                look at the earthlings. Goodbye! You really think you can fly
                that thing? Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist?

                on your dinosaur tour, right? What do they got in there? King
                Kong? Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get
